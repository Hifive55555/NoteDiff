\chapter{Geometry in Euclidean Space}

In this section, we are going to derive what a tangent vector or a cotangent vector is,
give them a good definition and have a new view on differential and derivative. \textit{(We will
ignore many detials in order to grasp the very idea instead of being lost in tedious derivation.)}
